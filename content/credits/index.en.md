## Who should I thank

This site is powered by the popular Hugo static site generator.

Atom and VSCodium editors

The theme is based on Hugo ReFreshment, great ideas by Roberto Giordani implemented in the [Hugo ReFresh theme] theme (https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-fresh/), as well as solutions in Hugo Fresh themes.

The reason for the new Hugo ReFreshment theme is that the [Hugo ReFresh theme] (https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-fresh/) uses the beautiful and modern "Bulma" framework. But all the virtues of Bumla could not overshadow the power of [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com). In addition, it turns out that reworking the theme is easier than making changes to hundreds of pages developed over the past five years.

The project uses the components of the plugin [dark-mode-switch] (https://github.com/coliff/dark-mode-switch), which was developed by Christian Oliff, which allows the user to enable dark mode. This is important as not all browsers offer this feature yet. And if they do, the colors they suggest might not match our ReFreshment theme.

A font size switch is also used.
